        In our project 3, we decided to start off with a scatterplot showcasing the average temperature of each mice 
        in accordance to their average activity level, with each mouse labeled by their respective mouse ID, gender, 
        temperature, and activity. Then, users would be able to toggle buttons relating to attributes of the mouse 
        (gender, activity, etc…). Initially, we intended to have questions that acted as a toggle to find the mouse
         that best matched the users interest. In this case, the toggle would have only a yes or no option, and mice 
         that were similar to what the user selected (ie. female) would be displayed. Essentially, we would be filtering
          the scatterplot—keeping the same axis on both sides—but changing which mice are displayed based on their 
          features and the features that were selected by the user. However, after implementing this, we wanted to 
          incorporate more of an interactive element to our website in addition to the toggles, so taking what we learned 
          from lab 6, we incorporated the brushing technique to allow the user to select a subset of the mice. From here, 
          we wanted to showcase each individual mice’s features more, such that the user could pinpoint which mouse would 
          be most similar to themselves. To do so, we added a line chart that showcased each of the average activity 
          levels of the selected mice over a day (in 10 minute intervals) in addition to the scatter plot. We decided 
          to implement this line chart in addition to the original scatterplot because we believed it would provide a 
          more visual representation of individual mice and their activity levels, and it would allow users to see more
           details and intricate trends that might not have been able to be seen from the scatterplot alone. Looking at 
           the some specific visual encodings, in both the line plot and the scatter plot.

        For the overall project, we split up into 2 groups—Flavia and Alyx, and Grace and Jennifer. 
        For the checkpoint, we spent roughly 4 hours all together (3 hours for developing and making the charts, 
        and 1 hour for setting up the website). From the checkpoint, Flavia and Alyx focused on making the graphs 
        and the video submission, while Grace and Jennifer focused on the title/question as well as making progress 
        with the website. From the checkpoint to the final project, all 4 of us collectively spent around 4 hours as
         well. Flavia and Alyx focused on the plotting aspects, while Grace and Jennifer worked on the html side (ie. 
         building toggles/switches) and the JS side (event listener to translate the toggle inputs into filtering queues). 
         This accounts for setting up the interactive elements such as making the toggles work, as well as implementing 
         the brushing technique to be able to select a subset of the mice to draw subsequent activity charts with. 
         One of the most time-consuming parts of this project was getting the selection box to function correctly. 
         This included translating the selected area into individual mice, ensuring that each selected mouse's ID was
          displayed, and accurately updating the count to reflect the total number of mice selected. Another challenging
           area that we came across was making updates in the graph while not breaking anything beforehand and ensuring 
           everything worked properly.
